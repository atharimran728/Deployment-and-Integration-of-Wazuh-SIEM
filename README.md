# Deployment-and-Integration-of-Wazuh-SIEM
This assignment is submitted to Bytewsie Cybersecurity fellowship, Sep 2024. The goal of this assignment is to gain hands-on experience with deploying Wazuh SIEM, integrating it with other machines, and creating custom security rules within Wazuh. Additionally, learn to utilize regular expressions for extracting properties from log payloads.

## Objective:

The objective of this assignment is to familiarize yourself with the deployment of IBM QRadar, the integration of Ubuntu and Windows 10 machines, and the creation of custom security rules. You will also gain hands-on experience with regular expressions by extracting properties from a selected payload.

## Assignment Instructions:

### 1-Deploy QRadar:
-Set up IBM QRadar in your preferred environment (VM, cloud, etc.).
-Ensure that QRadar is up and running.

### 2-Integrate Ubuntu and Windows 10 Machines:
-Integrate an Ubuntu machine with your QRadar instance.
-Integrate a Windows 10 machine with QRadar.-
-Ensure that both machines are properly sending logs to QRadar.

### 3-Create Two Custom Rules:
-Develop one custom rule specific to the Ubuntu machine.
-Develop one custom rule specific to the Windows 10 machine.
-Ensure that these rules trigger based on specific conditions that you define.

### 4-Payload Selection and Property Extraction:
-Choose any one payload from the logs (e.g., an event generated from Ubuntu or Windows 10).
-Use regular expressions to extract all properties from the selected payload.
-Document the regular expressions used and the extracted properties.

### 5-Documentation:
Prepare a document that includes:
-A step-by-step guide on the deployment of QRadar.
-The process of integrating Ubuntu and Windows 10 machines.
-The logic and configuration of the two custom rules you created.
-The selected payload, the regular expressions used, and the extracted properties.
-Include screenshots of each step to demonstrate the process and results.
