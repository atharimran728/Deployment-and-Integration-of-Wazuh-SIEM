# Deployment and Integration of Wazuh SIEM
This assignment is submitted to Bytewsie Cybersecurity fellowship, Sep 2024. The goal of this assignment is to gain hands-on experience with deploying Wazuh SIEM, integrating it with other machines, and creating custom security rules within Wazuh. Additionally, learn to utilize regular expressions for extracting properties from log payloads.

## Objective:

The goal of this assignment is to gain hands-on experience with deploying Wazuh SIEM, integrating it with Ubuntu and Windows 10 machines, and creating custom security rules within Wazuh. Additionally, you will learn to utilize regular expressions for extracting properties from log payloads.

## Assignment Instructions:

### Deploy Wazuh SIEM:

Deploy Wazuh SIEM in your preferred environment (virtual machine, cloud, etc.).

Ensure that Wazuh is up and running and accessible.

Integrate Ubuntu and Windows 10 Machines:

### Ubuntu Integration:
Install and configure the Wazuh agent on your Ubuntu machine to send logs to Wazuh SIEM.

Confirm that log data from the Ubuntu machine is being collected and displayed in Wazuh.

### Windows 10 Integration:
Install and configure the Wazuh agent on your Windows 10 machine to forward logs to Wazuh SIEM.

Verify that the Windows 10 machine is sending logs to Wazuh as expected.

### Create Two Custom Rules:

#### Ubuntu Rule:
Develop a custom rule in Wazuh specific to the log data generated by the Ubuntu machine. For instance, you might create a rule to detect suspicious login attempts or other security events.

#### Windows 10 Rule:
Develop a custom rule in Wazuh for Windows 10 log data. For example, you could create a rule to identify unauthorized access attempts or unusual application installations.
Ensure that these rules trigger based on the specific conditions you define.

### Payload Selection and Property Extraction:

Select a log payload from Wazuh, either from Ubuntu or Windows 10 logs.

Use regular expressions to extract relevant properties from the chosen payload. For example, you might extract fields such as timestamps, event types, and user IDs.

Document the regular expressions used and the properties extracted.

#### Documentation: Prepare a comprehensive document that includes:

### Wazuh Deployment Guide:
A detailed, step-by-step guide on deploying Wazuh SIEM, including any configuration settings.

#### Integration Process:
Describe the process of integrating Ubuntu and Windows 10 machines with Wazuh SIEM.

Include screenshots of the integration steps and settings.
#### Custom Rules:
Explain the logic and configuration of the two custom rules you created.

Include screenshots of the rule configurations in Wazuh.

#### Payload Analysis:
Provide the details of the selected payload, the regular expressions used for extraction, and the extracted properties.

Include examples of the payload data and the results of your regular expression queries.

Ensure the documentation is clear, well-organized, and professional.
